This class is not used as of yet
so we will comment it out for now

public class Shop {
    /simple implementation of inventory right now, will create an interface(?) in phase 1
    protected List<ShopItem> inventory;

    public Shop() {
        this.inventory = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addItem(ShopItem item) {
        inventory.add(item);
    }

    public void removeItem(ShopItem item) {
        inventory.remove(item);
    }

    sell item method for when the player buys something?
}
